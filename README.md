Shisito is a Github action used for validating markdown/YAML files as part of your CI pipeline.

- **Build static websites, safer.** Use frameworks like [GatsbyJS](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby)
  and [https://jekyllrb.com/](https://jekyllrb.com/) to host your content without having to
  worry about corrupted markdown files upond deployment.

- **Be alerted of errors before you deploy.** Since Shisito is fully integration with Github
  actions, you can add markdown/YAML validation to your CI pipeline easily, for free, and be
  alerted on critical errors before your content goes live.

### Getting started

1. ** First, dd Shisito to your Github workflow. **

The first step will be to add the Shisito action to your [Github workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions).

In your your workflow `.yml` file, add Shisito as a step. For example, a simple CI file (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that runs on any push, may look like the following (excluding any other steps you might add):

```
name: CI
on: [push]

jobs:
  build-library:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: build-library
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      # Find most recent version at: https://github.com/teddywilson/shisito/releases
      - uses: teddywilson/shisito@{VERSION}
```

2. ** Define your Shisito configuration file. **

In the root directory of your project, you must define a `shisito.yml` file. This configuration file provides Shisito with the information it needs to run tests against your markdown files.

An example `shisito.yml` file:

```
collections:
  -
    filepattern: authors/*
    fields:
      - name: str    
  -
    filepattern: events/*
    fields:
      - name: str
      - max_capacity: int
      - hosts: list
```

Supported types: `[str, int, list]`
NOTE: list type validation (e.g., `list(int)`) is not supported currently, but will be soon.

The `filepattern` string follows standard Unix file expansion. E.g., (`files/*`, `content/*/*.md`, `files/*.markdown`). If you don't specify a file extension all files in the matching directory will be ran against validation tests.

### Examples
Follow the main example project for a better overview of how Shisito works end to end here: https://github.com/teddywilson/example-shisito-project.

If you have any example projects to offer, please add them here!

### Testing
Currently testing is pretty limited, but I am working on it. For the time being, to test out new functionality, clone the sample project, and run it using a local build of Shisito.

For example:
```
git clone https://github.com/teddywilson/example-shisito-project

cd shisito
Docker build -t shisito .

Docker run \
  -v /Path/to/example-shisito-project:/github/workspace \
  shisito
```

Any help with testing/setup would be greatly appreciated!

### Contributing
Since Shisito has only just begun development, there is tons of work to do! The main focus at the time being is adding more functionality to the markdown validation test runner. Some of these tasks include the following:
- More field and type validation, namely list(subtype) validation.
- Type validation beyond primitives â€“ e.g., phone numbers, emails, etc.
- Literally anything!
